# TDSPROJECT_2final
# 🤖 LLM-Based Automation Agent

A lightweight **automation agent** powered by **OpenAI GPT API**, designed to interpret plain-English instructions or academic assignment questions and return automated responses through RESTful APIs.

This project demonstrates how to integrate **Large Language Models (LLMs)** into backend systems for intelligent task automation.

---

## 🚀 Overview

The **Automation Agent** acts as a middleware between the user and the OpenAI GPT model.  
It accepts user instructions (for example: *“Explain SVM in simple terms”*), forwards them to the GPT API, and returns a structured, meaningful answer as a JSON response.

---

## ⚙️ Features

- 🧠 Uses OpenAI GPT API for generating responses.
- 🔌 RESTful API endpoints built with **FastAPI** / **Flask**.
- ⚡ Supports multiple types of queries: explanations, summaries, answers, or code snippets.
- 🔑 Secure environment variable handling for API key.
- 📦 Modular architecture with clean folder structure.

---

## 🧠 How It Works

1. The user sends a request to the API endpoint with a question or instruction.
2. The backend processes the input and calls the **OpenAI API**.
3. The GPT model generates the appropriate response.
4. The backend formats and returns it as a clean, structured output.

Example:

**Request:**
```json
{
  "task": "Explain supervised learning in simple terms"
}


Response:

{
  "response": "Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where models are trained on labeled data to make predictions on new data."
}

⚡️ Setup and Run
1. Clone the Repository

git clone https://github.com/your-username/LLM-Automation-Agent.git
cd LLM-Automation-Agent

2. Create Virtual Environment

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows use venv\Scripts\activate


3. Install Dependencies

pip install -r requirements.txt


4. Add OpenAI API Key

Create a .env file in the project root and add:

OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here


5. Run the Application

python app/main.py


API will start running on 👉 http://127.0.0.1:5000/

🧪 Example Usage

POST request to /api/execute
Body:

{
  "task": "What is linear regression?"
}


Response:

{
  "response": "Linear regression is a method to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables."
}


🎯 Future Enhancements

Add multiple LLM options (Claude, Gemini, etc.)

Add caching for repeated queries.

Add support for structured task pipelines.

Integrate frontend for direct question input.
